# Shark-Tank-Data-Analysis


Data Analysis is all about Manipulating Data according to our needs. In this Example, we are using Shark Tank data which tells us about how many offers were made, at what price and equity and also tells about the Category the Startup is based on.

Shark Tank is a program that allows various Unicorn founders to invest in the newly launched Startups and help the Startups to grow and up scale. This data includes some key informations like Brand Name, Location where the Startup is situated, Idea on which the Startup is based, Sector of the Startup, Deal made at what Amount and Equity(Shares), Amount Asked by the Founders and Co-Founders of the Startup, etc.
